Here are several improvements you can make to your project for better maintainability, reliability, and scalability:

---

### 1. **Sensor Data Buffering & Deferred Sending**
- **Current:** Data is sent immediately after reading.
- **Improve:** Buffer sensor readings (in RAM or flash/filesystem) and send them in batches (e.g., twice a day). This saves power and bandwidth, and prevents data loss if the network is down.

---

### 2. **Use Filesystem for Data Logging**
- **Current:** Only GPS data is stored in Preferences.
- **Improve:** Use LittleFS or SPIFFS to store sensor readings as CSV or binary files, allowing you to keep days/weeks of data and send in bulk.

---

### 3. **Error Handling & Retries**
- **Current:** Minimal error handling for sensor and modem failures.
- **Improve:** Add robust error handling and retry logic for sensor reads, modem/network failures, and flash writes. Log errors for diagnostics.

---

### 4. **Watchdog Timer**
- **Current:** Not shown in this snippet.
- **Improve:** Ensure a hardware watchdog is enabled and regularly fed to recover from hangs.

---

### 5. **Power Management**
- **Current:** Uses deep sleep, but could be optimized.
- **Improve:** Minimize power usage by:
  - Powering down unused peripherals.
  - Using RTC memory to retain state across deep sleep.
  - Only waking up for scheduled tasks.

---

### 6. **Configuration Management**
- **Current:** Many parameters are hardcoded.
- **Improve:** Store configuration (e.g., send times, sensor intervals, server info) in Preferences or a config file, and allow remote updates via MQTT or SMS.

---

### 7. **Code Structure & Modularity**
- **Current:** Good use of header/source files, but could be further modularized.
- **Improve:** 
  - Separate networking, sensor, storage, and utility code into distinct modules.
  - Use classes for sensors and communication if the project grows.

---

### 8. **MQTT Support**
- **Current:** Not implemented.
- **Improve:** Add MQTT for reliable, lightweight data transfer and remote control/configuration.

---

### 9. **OTA Updates**
- **Current:** Not implemented.
- **Improve:** Add OTA (Over-The-Air) update capability for remote firmware upgrades.

---

### 10. **Diagnostics & Logging**
- **Current:** Serial prints for debugging.
- **Improve:** Implement a logging system (to file or remote server) for persistent diagnostics.

---

### 11. **Time Synchronization**
- **Current:** Uses GPS and RTC.
- **Improve:** Also support NTP as a fallback for time sync.

---

### 12. **Security**
- **Current:** Not shown.
- **Improve:** Use TLS for data transmission, secure MQTT, and protect stored data if needed.

---

### 13. **Documentation**
- **Current:** Some comments and docstrings.
- **Improve:** Add README, usage examples, and more detailed documentation for maintainers.
